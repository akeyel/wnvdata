FIPS codes and CDC locations to facilitate merging data sets by either FIPS or by location
<<<<<<< HEAD
FIPS Lookup was derived from:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2017/demo/popest/2017-fips.html
Link: 2017 State, County, Minor Civil Division, and Incorporated Place FIPS Codes
file: all-geocodes-v2017.xlsx
Changes were made manually in Excel in order to condense to four columns ready to use for
the CDC forecast challenge.
"South Dakota-Oglala Lakota/Shannon" was replaced with "South Dakota-Oglala Lakota" using R
county gives the state and county, fips the census fips (without a leading zero), the state
fips (also without a leading zero), and the location (which is the same as the county field,
but with the name location for easier joining to forecast challenge data)
