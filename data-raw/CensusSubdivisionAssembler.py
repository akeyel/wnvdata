# Take US Census SubDivision Data by state and merge into a single, usable file

#**# Need to think about whether the State data would actually be more useful
# for data requests. Most analyses are at the level of the state, so we 
# may not actually benefit from creating a composited US file. Because we are
# NOT going to get human data at this resolution from CDC.

#**# NOT SCRIPTED - REALIZED STATE-SPECIFIC ANALYSES WERE A MORE SENSIBLE PLACE TO START

# Unzip census data

# Create new shapefile to hold results

# Loop through remaining states

# Unzip census data

# Add to shapefile

# Save final composite shapefile
